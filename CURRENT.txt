I have the site hosted at duckfuck.cf
The signup form works to save the data in an SQL database but the email does

Sessions are almost working.

Things that need to be updated:
	CSS across the site.
	Adding user's name, bio, and other pictures to the swiping page.
	Replacing user's email with their name in the chat and match pages.
